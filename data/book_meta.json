    "22": "to make one respectableperson!\" Soon her eye fellon a littleglassbox that was lyingunder the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT ME \" were beautifullymarked in currants. \" Well, I'lleat it,\" said Alice, \" and if itmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so eitherway I'llget intothe garden, and I don'tcarewhich happens!\" She ate a littlebit, and said anxiouslyto herself,\"Which way ?

So she began",
    "38": "again: \" Où est ma chatte ?\" which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.

Very soon the Rabbit noticedAlice, as she went hunting about, and calledout to her in an angry tone, \" Why , Mary Ann , what are",
    "60": "you doing out here? Run home this moment , and fetchme a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now !\" And Alicewas so much frightenedthat she ran off at once in the directionit pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake that it had made . \" He took me for his housemaid,\" she said to herselfas she ran. \" How surprisedhe'llbe when he finds out who I am ! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves that is, if I can find them.\" As she saidthis, she came upon a neat littlehouse, on the door of",

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothingelseto do, and perhapsafter all it might tellher somethingworth hearing. For some minutes it puffedaway without speak- ing, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the",
    "87": "hookahout of itsmouth again, and said, \"So you thinkyou'rechanged, do you ?\" \"I'm afraidI am , sir,\" said Alice; \"I can't remember things as I used- and I don't keep the same sizefor ten minutes together!\" \" Can't remember what things?\" said the Caterpillar. \"Well, I've tried to say 'How doth the littlebusy bee,' but it all came different!\" Alicerepliedin a very melancholyvoice. 6 \"Repeat You are old, Father William, \" saidthe Caterpillar.

For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in liverycame run- ning out of the wood- (she consideredhim to be a footman because he was in livery: other- wise, judgingby hisfaceonly, she would have calledhim a fish)- and rappedloudlyatthedoor with his knuckles.

    "104": "little, \" From the Queen . An invi- tationforthe Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangledtogether. Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearingher; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone,and theotherwas sitting on the ground near the door, staringstupidlyup intothe sky. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked . \" There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman , \" and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of",
    "105": "the door as you are; secondly, becausethey'remaking such a noiseinside, no one couldpossiblyhearyou.\" And certainlythere was a most extraordinary noisegoing on within a constanthowling and sneezing, and every now and then a great PIG AND PEPPER . 79 crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \" Please,then,\"saidAlice,\"how am I togetin?\" \" There might be some sensein your knock- ing,\" the Footman went on, without attending to her, \"if we had the door between us.

    "108": "you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling. \" Oh, there'sno use in talkingto him,\" said Alicedesperately: \"he's perfectlyidiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, PIG AND PEPPER . 81 which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sittingon a three-legged stoolin the middle, nursing a baby ; the cook was leaningoverthe fire,stirringa largecauldron which seemed to be fullof soup. \" There'scertainlytoo much pepperin that soup !\" Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

The only two creaturesin the kitchenthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a largecat which was sittingon the hearth and grinningfrom ear to ear . \" Please, would you tellme,\" saidAlice, a littletimidly, forshe was not quitesure whether itwas good manners forher to speakfirst, \"why your catgrinslikethat?\" \" It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \" and that'swhy .

While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everythingwithinher reachat the Duchess and the baby- the fire- ironscame first; then followed a shower of sauce- pans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no noticeof them even when they hither; and the baby was howlingso much already, thatitwas quite impossibleto say whether the blows hurt it or not . \" Oh, pleasemind what you'redoing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and",

    "115": "\" I must go and get ready to play croquetwith the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan afterher as she went, but itjustmissed her. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as itwas a queer-shaped littlecreature, and held out itsarms and legs in alldirections, \"just likea star-fish,\" thought Alice. The poor little thing was snortinglike a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itselfup and straighteningitselfout again, so that altogether, for the firstminute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it.
